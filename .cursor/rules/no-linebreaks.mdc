# Line Break Formatting

## Rules

- Don't add extra line breaks between variable definitions and code blocks
- Small functions don't need line breaks between statements

## Bad

```ts
function Foo() {
    bar := "bar"

    bar = "baz"

    return
}
```

## Good

```ts
function Foo() {
    bar := "bar"
    bar = "baz"
    return
}
```
